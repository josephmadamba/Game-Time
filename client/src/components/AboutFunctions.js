    <p>
      The purpose of PickUpe.com is to help people find and play pickup
      basketball games. We wanted to create a place where people looking for
      games could find accurate, up-to-date information and game coordinators
      could easily publish that information. We also wanted to create a way for
      the communities around a game to stay connected and keep a running dialog
      about their game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Future goal is to create a profile system to display competitive level
      and ranking of the user.
